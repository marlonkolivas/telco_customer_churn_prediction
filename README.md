# Title: Telco Customer Churn Prediction
---
### Objective:
This project focuses on building a **machine learning model** to predict customer churn in the telecommunications industry. Customer churn occurs when a customer discontinues a company’s services. By identifying the factors that contribute to churn, telecom companies can take proactive steps to retain customers, reduce revenue loss, and improve customer satisfaction.

### Dataset Description
The dataset used in this project contains various customer attributes, including **demographic information** (such as gender, seniority, and marital status), **account details** (like contract type, payment method, and tenure), and **service usage patterns** (such as internet service type, monthly charges, and total charges).

The goal is to analyze these features, uncover insights into why customers leave, and build a predictive model that accurately identifies customers at high risk of churn. The final solution will include a Streamlit dashboard that allows users to explore data insights and make real-time churn predictions based on customer input.
